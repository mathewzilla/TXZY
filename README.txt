Hi Mat,

Here are some data from the Barrett Hand touching two different boxes.
The files with the name "box_sample_x_fy.txt" contain the pressure, the x is the number of  trial and y is the number of the fingertip. 
The files with the name "position_box_sample_x.txt" contain the positions where the contact was detected.

I collected the position using the function RTGetPosition which comes with the library provided by Barrett Hand, however I am not sure if the values are correct. I'll check that later.

Cheers
Uriel
